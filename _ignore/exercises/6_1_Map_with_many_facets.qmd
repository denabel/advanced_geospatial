### Exercises

Now that we know how to map several layers simultaneously with `ggplot()`, we want to explore the population in Texas in the four years 2017-2020. We will plot both `terra` and `stars` objects.

::: callout-note
## `r emo::ji("weight_lifting_man")` Exercise 1

In the previous session, we have created a raster stack and a raster cube for the four years in Texas. If these are not in your environment anymore, please load both (`./data/TX_pop_stack.tif` and `./data/TX_pop_cube.rds`). 

In addition, load the county shapefiles for Texas with the `tigris` package. Reproject it to the CRS of your raster files.
:::

::: callout-note
## `r emo::ji("weight_lifting_man")` Exercise 2

You are already proficient in creating publication-ready maps. Please create two plots - one for the `terra` object and another one for the `stars` object. Utilize the `facet_wrap()` command to separate the plot along the four years of the data.

Polish it as much as you like (NAs transparent, theme, titles, and North arrow and scale bar,...).
:::

::: callout-note
## `r emo::ji("weight_lifting_man")` Exercise 3

Add your Texas counties shapefile to the plots with `geom_sf()`. 
:::

::: callout-note
## `r emo::ji("weight_lifting_man")` Exercise 4

Let's use `ggplot` to create a plot which contains the shapefile and raster file. Adjust the color scheme by utilizing `scale_fill_viridis_c`, `scale_fill_distiller`, or `scale_fill_gradient2`.
:::

::: callout-note
## `r emo::ji("weight_lifting_man")` Exercise 5

We want to point out counties which experience high population growth. Please attach labels to the top three counties by population growth. You can utilize `slice_head(n = 3)` after ordering the data in descending order to select only those three observations. Add this as an additional layer to the plot as text or text labels.
:::

::: callout-note
## `r emo::ji("weight_lifting_man")` Exercise 6

What else could enhance your map? Polish it for publication, for example, by:

-   Turn NAs transparent,
-   Add titles,
-   Adjust the overall theme of the plot,
-   Add a North arrow and scale bar.
