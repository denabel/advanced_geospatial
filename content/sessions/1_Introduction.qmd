## The goal of this course

This course will teach you how to exploit `R` and apply its geospatial techniques in a social science context.

By the end of this course, you should...

-   Be comfortable with using **raster data** in `R`
-   Including importing and wrangling single **raster layers** as well as **raster stacks and cubes**
-   Have a fundamental understanding of **spatial geometries** and how these are manipulated in `R`  
-   Be able to create publication-ready **maps** of raster layers and stacks
-   Not be afraid to explore access to **remote sensing APIs** for your own research questions

## We are (necessarily) selective

There's a multitude of spatial `R` packages

-   We cannot cover all of them
-   And we cannot cover all functions
-   You may have used some we are not familiar with

We will show the use of packages we exploit in practice

-   There's always another way of doing things in `R`
-   Don't hesitate to bring up your solutions

**You can't learn everything at once, but you also don't have to!**

## Geospatial data in social sciences

A growing interest in economics and the social sciences in geospatial and Earth 
observation data has led to a broad spectrum of publications in recent years. We have
identified four major subject areas which have been addressed with EO data recently:

## Geospatial data in this course I

In the folder called `./data`, you can find (most of) the data files prepared for all the exercises and slides. The following data are included:

- Administrative borders of Germany (Prefix *VG250\_*) are provided by the German [Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy](http://www.bkg.bund.de) (2018). Check out their [Open Data Portal](https://gdz.bkg.bund.de/index.php/default/open-data.html).

- German Census 2022 data are provided by the [Federal Statistical Office Germany, Wiesbaden 2024](https://www.zensus2022.de). We used our colleague [Jonas Lieth](https://www.gesis.org/institut/ueber-uns/mitarbeitendenverzeichnis/person/Jonas.Lieth)'s (experimental)  `R`package [`z22`](https://github.com/JsLth/z22) to gather the data for you. If you're stuck using the data, `z22::z22_categories()` may help you (e.g., `z22::z22_categories("foreigners)`).


## Geospatial data in this course II

- WorldPop data are provided by a [research group based at the University of Southampton](https://www.worldpop.org/), offering high-resolution, open-access data on population distribution and demographics. The datasets combine census information, satellite imagery, and statistical modeling to support research, policy-making, and humanitarian efforts worldwide.

- Nighttime lights are derived from [NASA's Black Marble](https://blackmarble.gsfc.nasa.gov/) (Prefix *VNP46A4_*). The data has been accessed with Robert Marty's and Gabriel Stefanini Vicente's (2025) [blackmarbler](https://worldbank.github.io/blackmarbler/) package.

- ERA5 is provided by the [Copernicus Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu/) (C3S) and offers high-resolution, global reanalysis data on atmospheric, land, and oceanic variables. The datasets combine observations with models to produce consistent climate information used for research, forecasting, and environmental monitoring.


## Geospatial data in this course III

- The International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) [available at GESIS](https://search.gesis.org/research_data/ZA7650) is provided by a cross-national collaboration of research organizations, delivering annual survey data on social attitudes and behaviors. The datasets cover a wide range of topics like work, family, environment, and social inequality, supporting comparative social science research worldwide.

- The synthetic survey geocoordinates dataset is a simulated dataset comprising 2,000 spatial coordinates and one synthetic attribute related to migration status. It is designed for training and testing spatial analysis workflows without the constraints of real-world data privacy issues and was created using Stefan's experimental [`geosynth` `R` package](https://github.com/StefanJuenger/geosynth).

**Please make sure that if you reuse any of the provided data to cite the original data sources.**


## Refresher: What are geospatial data?

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Data with a direct spatial reference

$\rightarrow$ **geo-coordinates** x, y (and z)

Visualizing geometries in different styles depending on format:

-   Vector data (points, lines, polygons)
-   Raster data (grids) 
-   Coordinate Reference System (CRS)

## Refresher: Types of CRS

You may hear from **geographic**, **geocentric**, **projected**, or **local** CRS.

What's the difference?

-   whether 2 dimensional (longitude, latitude) or 3 dimensional (+height) coordinates are used
-   the location of the coordinate system's origin (center of earth or not)
-   projection on a flat surface (transformation of longitudes and latitudes to x and y coordinates)
-   location (the smaller, the more precise the projections)

*In practice, what matters most is that two or more layers match when integrating them.*


## Refresher: Coordinate reference system (CRS)

- CRS is a reference system to determine the precise location of points in space
- GIS programs **MUST** know CRS for accurate processing, visualization, and analysis of data
- CRS is based on the **Geographic Coordinate System** (GCS) + the **Projected Coordinate System** (PCS)


## Refresher: Geographic Coordinate System (GCS)

*Necessary to know where exactly on Earth's surface data is located*

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- GCS uses three-dimensional spherical surface to define locations based on **datum** and **latitude** and **longitude** lines
- **Datum**: Mathematical model of the Earth that serves as reference point by defining size and shape of Earth
- **Local datum**: Optimizes fit for particular location (like NAD83)
- **Geocentric datum**: Optimizes fit for entire Earth (like Word Geodetic Survey 1984 - WGS84)
- **WGS84** is standard for GPS and many applications

## Refresher: Projected Coordinate System (PCS)

*Necessary to draw the data on a flat map*

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- PCS represents Earth' surface on a flat plane by mathematical transformations (projections)
- **Coordinate grid**: Here we talk about **x** and **y** coordinates (= easting and northing)
- Conversion of degrees of latitude and longitude into measurable units (like meters)

## Refresher: Common PCS - UTM

**Universal Transverse Mercator** (UTM) is a global map projection which:

- Projects globe onto a cylinder tangent to a central meridian
- Divides it into 60 zones
- Distortion is minimized within each zone
- Provides high accuracy for small areas

## Refresher: Documentation of CRS

Every geodata object requires a description of the CRS

- GCS and datum
- PCS
- x and y units (like meters)
- Domain (maximum allowable x and y values)
- Resolution


## Refresher: Old standard: `PROJ.4` strings

This is how your information about the CRS are defined in a classic standard:

```         
+proj=laea +lat_0=52 +lon_0=10 +x_0=4321000 +y_0=3210000 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs 
```

(It's nothing you would type by hand)


## Refresher: `WKT` (“Well Known Text”)

## Refresher: EPSG Codes

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Eventually, working with CRS in `R` will not be as challenging as it may seem since we don't have to use `PROJ.4` or `WKT` strings directly.

Most of the time, it's enough to use so-called EPSG Codes ("European Petroleum Survey Group Geodesy"), a small digit sequence.

## Refresher: What is GIS?

Most common understanding: **Geographic Information Systems** (GIS) as specific software to process geospatial data for

-   Visualization
-   Analysis
-   Interpretation

$\rightarrow$ In our case, of course, it is `R`

But base `R` is limited when it comes to handling geospatial data
