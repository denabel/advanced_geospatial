## Workshop Description
A growing interest in economics and the social sciences in Earth observation (EO) 
data has led to a broad thematic spectrum of publications in recent years. 
They range from studying environmental attitudes and behavior, 
economic development, conflicts and causes of flight, and electoral behavior. 
However, working with EO data requires advanced knowledge of geospatial data 
processing. Social science researchers face many obstacles in applying and using 
these data, resulting from 1) a lack of technical expertise, 2) a lack of knowledge 
of data sources and how to access them, 3) unfamiliarity with complex data formats, 
such as high-resolution, longitudinal raster datacubes, and 4) a lack of expertise 
in integrating the data into existing social science datasets. After all, despite 
the increased interest in the data, for the majority of researchers in the social 
sciences, complex geospatial data derived from remote sensing represents a black box.
 
This course aims to address this gap. We will focus on data access from large 
databases via APIs, data wrangling of raster data and datacubes, and introduction 
of workflow for data integration with users' datasets, such as survey data. This 
course is advanced and suitable for students and scientists who feel familiar 
with R and have some basic knowledge of working with geodata.
